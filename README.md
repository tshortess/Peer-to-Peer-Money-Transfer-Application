# Peer-to-Peer Money Transfer Application
This was the second capstone project in the Tech Eelvator Java program.

I worked with another student to develop a peer-to-peer money transfer application based on the README.md in the mod2-capstone-blue-t3/18_Capstone/student/java folder.

To test out the application, go to the README.md file in the mod2-capstone-blue-t3/18_Capstone/student/java folder and set up your database according to those instructions.

Next, open the pom.xml for the server folder(found in the mod2-capstone-blue-t3/18_Capstone/student/java/tenmo-server folder) in IntelliJ or your preferred Java IDE and run the TenmoApplication main method. Once the server is running, open the pom.xml for the client folder(found in the mod2-capstone-blue-t3/18_Capstone/student/java/tenmo-client folder) in IntelliJ or your preferred Java IDE and run the App main method.
